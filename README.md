# StatProfilerHTML

This module formats the output from Julia's Profile module into an html
rendering of the source function lines and functions, allowing for interactive
exploration of any bottlenecks that may exist in your code.

Have a look [at this example output](http://www.infty.nl/StatProfilerHTML.jl/example-output/).

This is based on Mattia Barbon and Steffen MÃ¼ller's [Devel::StatProfiler](https://github.com/mbarbon/devel-statprofiler).
